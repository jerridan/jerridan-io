    .introduction
      p Hello! My name is Jerridan Quiring, and I’m a developer located in downtown Toronto. When I’m not coding or
        | &nbsplearning something new, you might find me reading a fiction novel in a coffee shop, camping in Muskoka, or
        | travelling to new and exciting places.
      p My skill set mainly revolves around building and deploying JavaScript-based web applications with tools like
        | &nbspNode.js, React and AngularJS. I also have experience with languages like PHP and C, creating responsive
        | &nbspwebsites, and basic Linux-based server administration.
